# Skip-List-
This project involves creating a simple spatial database to manage a collection of rectangles using a Skip List data structure. The database supports operations such as inserting, deleting, and querying rectangles. Queries include finding rectangles that cover a specific point or overlap with a query rectangle and reporting all intersections within the collection. While the Skip List offers efficient performance for non-spatial queries, it performs poorly on spatial queries, highlighting the need for more advanced data structures in future implementations.
